NB. derived col

0 : 0
derived col
 values calculated = usually from another col
 not mapped
 allowed in ref
 not allowed in a ptable
 calculated when first referenced
 not allowed in insert/upsert/update/... pairs

 calculated with verb derived_mapped_xxxx defined in custom.ijs
  xxxx is from jd'createcol /derived col type [trailing shape] xxxx'

 csv dumps data (not derived_xxxx verb)
 jdloadcustom loads changes to custom.ijs to db locale
 
 mark dirty whenever a dependency might have changed
 mark dirty is agressive - e.g. in perhaps most case sort would be ok
 but instead sort does not sort derived and marks them dirty
 sort/dropcol/delete all mark derived dirty
