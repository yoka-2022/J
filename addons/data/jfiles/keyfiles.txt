keyfiles.ijs
============

This script contains definitions for a keyed file system.

This is a modification and enhancement of the "kfiles" system.

A keyed file is a J component file in which data is accessed
using keywords.

The keyed file directory is stored in a single component.

Data may be stored in two ways. By default, data is stored in
one component per key; this is appropriate where the data for
any key can be arbitrarily large. Otherwise, data can be stored
in a single component for all records; here this is called
"extra" data. A keyed file may contain either or both types
of data.

For example, a keyed filed might have stock identifiers as the
key, and timeseries of stock prices as the data. Extra data
could include the full stock name.

Data can be accessed using one or more keys. A single key may
be given as an open item, two or more keys as a boxed list.
Omitting the keys is equivalent to specifying all keys.

Results are boxed lists, with the same shape as the boxed keys.

-----------------------------------------------------
main functions:

      keycreate 'file'            create keyed file

      keydir 'file'               keyword directory
      keyerase 'file'             erase file

      keyread 'file'[;keys]       read data
 data keywrite 'file'[;keys]      write data

      keyreadx 'file'[;keys]      read extra data
 data keywritex 'file'[;keys]     write extra data

      keydrop 'file';keys         drop keys

Here, "keys" is a boxed list of one or more keys, so
that 'file';keys is a 2-element list. An open list is
treated as a single key, for example:

      keyread 'file';'one'
      keyread 'file';<'one';'two';'three'

-----------------------------------------------------
On write, an open item is boxed. Otherwise, the length of
the data should be a scalar, or match the number of keys
being written.

file layout:

  cpt   description
   0    'keyed file 2'
  1-7   unused
   8    extras directory
   9    directory
  10+   data components

-----------------------------------------------------
error results:

   0  file create failed
  _1  file not found
  _2  invalid component
  _3  invalid data
  _4  invalid key
