Directory: examples/socket

This directory contains scripts to use J as a socket server,
and as a client to the J socket server. The scripts are:

client.ijs      - socket client
server.ijs      - socket server
serverw.ijs     - socket server showing commands in a window.

Utility scripts:
clifns.ijs      - client
servfns.ijs     - server
servfnsw.ijs    - window server

You can invoke these files as the initial file specified
in the command line. No other scripts are required.

If using J.DLL as the server, you should run server.ijs

Method
------
Load J and run either server.ijs or serverw.ijs
  (you can set up an icon/shortcut to do this)

Load another copy of J and run client.ijs

Client Verbs
------------
  sockopen ''      open socket (this is run automatically
                                when client.ijs is loaded)

Verbs that communicate using J's internal data structure:

  sockcmd          send command, get response
  sockdo           send command, ignore response
  sockget          get value of name (noun)
  sockset          set value of name (noun)

Verb that communicates using text only, with result in
clipboard format (useful for prototyping a non-J program
as the client):

  socktext         send command, get response

Special commands (arguments to sockcmd or socktext), e.g.
sockcmd 'show' :

  'close'          close socket
  'exit'           terminate J server
  'show'           display server
  'hide'           hide server

By default, the window server is shown, while the
non-window server is hidden.

For example, try:

  sockcmd 'i.2 3 4'
  socktext 'i.2 3 4'

  sockdo 'AA=: ?#~10'
  sockget 'AA'

  'AA' sockset i.5
  sockget 'AA'

  sockcmd 'show'
  sockcmd 'hide'

  sockcmd 'close'
  sockopen ''

  sockcmd 'exit'
