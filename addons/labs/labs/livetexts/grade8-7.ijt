Lab Section A. Purpose

This program is designed to accompany the text
"MATH 87", by Stephen Hake and John Saxon,
Saxon Publishers, Norman, Oklahoma, 1997.
It follows the text closely, and uses the programming
language J to illustrate and illuminate the topics.

To proceed through successive panels,
select menu Studio|Advance. Press Up Arrow or Page Up to

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section B. Use of J

J applies operations such as addition and multiplication
to lists of numbers as well as to individual numbers, and
can therefore bring out significant patterns
inherent in the mathematical operations. For example:
)
2+2
3*3
1 2 3 4 5 + 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 * 1 2 3 4 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section C. Comments

A comment can be added to any J expression
by using NB. (for the Latin Nota Bene -- Note Well).
Such a comment does not affect the execution of
the expression. For example:
)
1 2 3 4 5 + 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Gives even numbers

1 2 3 4 5 * 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Gives squares

1 2 3 4 5 % 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Division gives all ones

1 2 3 4 5 - 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Subtraction gives all zeros

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section D. Scrolling

You may use the up-arrow to scroll up to review
earlier material, and the down-arrow to scroll back
down. Try these, as well as the page-up and page-down
keys (labelled PgUp and PgDn) for faster scrolling.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section E. Verbs and Adverbs

We will refer to operations such as addition (+)
and multiplication (*) as "verbs" because they
perform actions, as do verbs in English.

In English an adverb applies to a verb to produce
a related verb, as in "walk slowly". Study the following
results and try to state the effect of the adverb / used
in the expressions:
)
1 2 3 4 5 +/ 1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5 */ 1 2 3 4 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section F. Bordered Tables

The result of the "modified" verb */ is a multiplication
table. Such a table can be made more readable by using
an alternative adverb (called table) to border it
by its arguments.

For example, the 3 in the left column of the
table indicates that the row
following it gives the 3-multiples of the list
in the top border:
)
1 2 3 4 5 *border 1 2 3 4 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section G. Division and Subtraction Tables

Bordered tables are more helpful in less familiar verbs:
)
1 2 3 4 5 %border 1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5 -border 1 2 3 4 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section H. Color

 Study verb tables
 for their patterns.
 They are shown
 more clearly by
 coloring equal
 results alike.
 Press the Esc
 key to remove the
 colored window:
)
1 2 3 4 5 +/ 1 2 3 4 5

color 1 2 3 4 5 +/ 1 2 3 4 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section I. Experimentation

You may experiment with any expressions
by entering them yourself. After typing
an expression press the key marked Enter
to execute it. For example, enter the
following expressions to produce a subtraction
table and to color it:

   1 2 3 4 5 -/ 1 2 3 4 5

   color 1 2 3 4 5 -/ 1 2 3 4 5

Note that you can avoid much typing
(and typing errors) by using the up-arrow
to scroll to any desired expression, pressing
Enter to bring it down to the input area, and then
pressing Enter again to execute it. Moreover, you can
revise it before the final entry by using
the left and right arrows and the Del (delete)
and BkSp (backspace) keys.

NB. =========================================================
Lab Chapter LESSONS 1-20
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 1-2. + - * %

This chapter begins the use of the HS (Hake, Saxon)
text. It is titled LESSONS 1-8 to indicate the
part of HS that it covers. Section names will
appear in the form 1-2. + - * % to indicate both
the relevant pages (1-2) of HS, and the
topics addressed.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

As is common in mathematics, we will also use the
term "argument" to refer to any one of the
terms such as "addend", "minuend", and "subtrahend".

As illustrated below, expressions such as 5+4 and 5-4 mean the same in HS and J,
but for multiplication J uses the more common * instead of the St. George's Cross
used in HS, and for division J uses the symbol %.

But there is
only one form for each verb in J, and
attempts to use any of the alternatives from HS
produce error messages:
)
5+4
5*4
5%4

5(4)
5/4

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Moreover, we will not use the form 4 + 3 = 7 to indicate
a solution, but can use (4 + 3) = 7, a matter to which we will
return after discussing parentheses (page 2 of HS)
and the comparison of numbers (pages 15-20 of HS).
)
(4 + 3) = 7

(4 + 3) = 6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 2-3. Parentheses

Punctuation in an English sentence
governs "the order in which the phrases
are evaluated", and can make an enormous
difference. For example:

 The teacher said George was stupid
 The teacher, said George, was stupid

Punctuation of math sentences is provided
similarly by parentheses: (12-7)-3 is
equivalent to 5-3, but 12-(7-3) is
equivalent to 12-4, a different result:
)
   (12-7)-3

   12-(7-3)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

In the preceding example of subtraction, the grouping
(or association) by parentheses made a difference.
In the case of addition, any grouping by parentheses
produces the same result, and addition is therefore said to be
"associative". For example:
)
   3+(4+(5+6))

   (3+4)+(5+6)

   ((3+4)+5)+6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Multiplication is also associative, an assertion you
may test by re-entering the foregoing examples of
addition after replacing each occurrence of + by *.

However, an expression with a mixture of additions
and multiplications is not associative, as
illustrated below:
)
3+(4*(5+6))

(3+4)*(5+6)

((3+4)*5)+6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 3-6. The counting numbers

The counting numbers can be defined by stating
that there is a first counting number called 1,
and that EVERY counting number has a successor.
This implies that counting numbers go on without
end, that is, that they are infinite.

In J there is a "successor" verb denoted by >:
that may be used as shown below:
)
>:1

>: >: 1

>: >: >: 1

>:3

>:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 651. Inverses

The inverse is an important idea in mathematics
that is defined in the Glossary on page 651 of
HS as follows:

 Two operations are inverse operations if one
 operation will "undo" the other operation. If
 we begin with 3 and multiply by 2, the product
 is 6. If we divide 6 by 2, we will undo the
 multiplication by 2, and the answer will be 3,
 the original number.

The successor verb >: has an inverse <: (called predecessor).
For example:
)
>:1
<:>:1
>:1 2 3 4 5 6
<:>:1 2 3 4 5 6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Inverses are often not "perfect inverses", and
may lead to puzzling but illuminating results.

For example, <: 2 clearly gives 1, but what is
the result of <:1 ? It cannot be a counting number,
because 1 is the FIRST counting number. In fact, <:1
leads us out of the counting numbers, into the broader
class of "whole numbers" or "integers" (as also defined
in the Glossary). The word "integer" comes from "in" meaning
"not", and "tag" meaning to touch (as in the
children's game), that is "untouched" or "unbroken".

For example:
)
<:1
<:<:1
<:<:<:1
<:<:<:<:1 2 3 4 5 6 7

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 4. Remainder

HS shows that 6 divides evenly into 234, but
that 56 into 1234 leaves a remainder of 2.
The remainder verb in J is denoted by |, and
provides a table with an interesting pattern:
)
6|234
56|1234
1234-(56|1234)        NB. Subtract remainder to get
(1234-(56|1234)) % 56 NB.  a result divisible by 56

color 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 |/ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 15-16. The number line

J provides two verbs that are convenient for
producing number lines:
)
i.6 NB. The first 6 non-negative integers

i:6 NB. The integers from _6 to 6

3 < i.6

3 < i:6

_3 < i:6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

They also provide interesting arguments for verb tables:
)
(i:3) *border (i:3)

(i:3) */ (i:3)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Coloring the preceding multiplication table shows a
pattern worth considerable study, in particular, the
way in which the row and column of zeros break the table
into four quadrants that alternate in sign:
)
color (i:3) */ (i:3)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 15-16. Comparing numbers

On page 16, HS states that "The comparison
symbols are the equals sign (=) and the greater
than/less than symbol (> or <)."

J uses the same symbols, but as verbs that produce
results, a result of 1 indicating that the relation
is true for the given arguments, and a result of 0 indicating
that it is not.
)
3<4
3=4
3>4
3<0 1 2 3 4 5 6
3=0 1 2 3 4 5 6
3>0 1 2 3 4 5 6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Again, these verbs produce tables with interesting patterns:
)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 </ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
color 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 </ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Enter expressions to produce and to color tables
for the remaining two relations.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

As promised, we will now return to the expression 12 - 7 = 5
that occurs on page 2 of HS:
)
(12 - 7) = 5 NB. The relation is true

7 = 5        NB. The result is 0

12 - (7 = 5)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 20-21. Adding and subtracting on the number line

These pages use the number line i:7 to illustrate ideas of
addition and subtraction:
)
i:7

3+i:7

(3+i:7)+2

((3+i:7)+2)=5

5+i:7

(5+i:7)-3

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 23-25. Reading and writing whole numbers

In J, the comma is used as a verb to chain together lists,
and it cannot, therefore, be used to break the digits of a
large integer into groups in the manner used in HS. We
will illustrate this by the number used in Example 3
on page 24:
)
3,406,521 NB. A list of three integers

3406521   NB. 3 million, 406 thousand, and 521

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Moreover, J gives the large number that results from the product
3406521 * 3406521 only approximately, using a form of the "scientific
notation" defined in the Glossary of HS (page 656). For example,
1.16044e13 denotes the number 1.16044 multiplied by 10 to the power
13 (that is, with the decimal point moved 13 places to the right).

However, the expression 3406521 * 3406521x in J yields the product
to complete (extended) precision. Thus:
)
3406521 * 3406521

3406521 * 3406521x

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 27-28. Factors

Among the factors of a number, the prime factors
are of particular importance. They are defined in
the Glossary of HS (page 654) as follows:

PRIME FACTORS The factors of a number that are prime numbers.

PRIME NUMBER A number greater than one whose only whole
number divisors are 1 and the number itself.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

In J, the verb q: gives the complete list of the prime factors
of its argument. For example:
)
q: 389340

2*2*3*3*3*5*7*103 NB. Product of all gives original argument

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section


The remainder verb (|) can be used to test whether one number is
a factor of another. For example:
)
103 | 389340 NB. Zero remainder indicates that 103 is a factor

q: 389340

(2*3*7)|389340 NB. product over any group of factors is a factor

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Choose other integers, and use q: to perform similar
experiments  on them.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 36-43 Fractions and mixed numbers

A number may be expressed in various equivalent ways. For example,
the fraction three-quarters may be expressed in decimal (0.75), in
scientific notation (75e_2), or even as a "rational" (3r4): Thus:
)
0.75
75e_2
0.75=75e_2
3r4
3r4=0.75
3r4-1r4
3r4-1r2

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Lists of rationals may also be used as arguments to
addition, multiplication, and other tables. For example:
)
1r2 1r3 1r4 1r5 1r6 +border 1r2 1r3 1r4 1r5 1r6

1r2 1r3 1r4 1r5 1r6 *border 1r2 1r3 1r4 1r5 1r6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Enter corresponding expressions for subtraction and
division tables.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Division of integers in J gives decimal approximations, unless
at least one of the arguments is in extended precision.
For example:
)
1%1 2 3 4 5 6 7

1%1 2 3 4 5 6 7x

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 44-68 Word Problems

The word problem of Example 1 of page 45
of HS appears as follows:

  Robert had 27 dollars. For his birthday he
  received 18 dollars more. Now how much money
  does Robert have?

The solution to this word problem (and to any
word problem) lies in finding which of our
mathematical tools to apply. These tools include
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
In other words, we may choose to use one or more of the
operations that we have developed.

We have called these operations "verbs", and will also
use the term "function" (introduced on page 650
of the Glossary of HS, and commonly used in mathematics).

In the present example, the choice of function is obvious:
)
27+18

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Problem 3 on page 47 of HS is stated as follows:

  What is the difference when the sum of 2, 3, and
  4 is subtracted from the product of 2, 3, and 4?

This clearly involves three functions: subtraction,
addition (sum), and multiplication (product). The
following steps might be used:
)
2+3+4             NB. Sum

2*3*4             NB. Product

24-9              NB. Difference

(2*3*4) - (2+3+4) NB. Complete statement

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Problems 10-16 on page 48 ask to "Find each missing
number", where the missing numbers are indicated
by the letters X, Y, Z, A, B, and C.

Such problems usually involve the use of an inverse
function; subtraction where addition occurs,
division where multiplication occurs, and so on.

Problem 10 is stated as follows:

   12,500
  +     X
  -------
   36,275
)
36275 - 12500 NB. Use inverse of addition

12500 + 23775 NB. Test the answer

(12500 + 23775) = 36275

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The testing of the answer is a most important part
of the solution of a problem, so much so that much
care should be taken to make thorough tests for
cases other than the values given in the statement
of the problem. For example, will the solution work
for negative arguments? Expressions such as i:3 and
1000*i:3 give lists of suitable values.

To illustrate the matter of thorough testing,
consider the following problem:

  What is the tax due on an income of 6400, from
  which you may deduct an exemption of 600 to get
  the taxable income. The tax is 10 percent (0.1)
  of the taxable income.

A solution may be written as follows:
)
6400 - 600        NB. Taxable income

0.1 * (6400 -600) NB. Tax due

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Now try the solution for a small income of 400:
)
400 - 600        NB. Taxable income

0.1 * (400 -600) NB. Tax due

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Would you really expect to get the refund indicated by
the negative tax of _20? No, a more careful statement
of the problem would say that if the income is not less
than the exemption, then ...

This seems to lead to a more complicated solution,
beginning with a test whose result is then used to
choose between two different calculations. However,
consider the following:
)
400-600        NB. Difference

0 >. (400-600) NB. Larger of (maximum of) 0 and difference

0.1 * (0 >. (400-600)) NB. Correct zero tax

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 77-79. Reducing fractions

If the numerator and denominator of a fraction are each
multiplied by the same integer, the result is an equivalent
fraction. For example:
)
3%4

(2*3)%(2*4)

(1 2 3 4 5 6*3)%(1 2 3 4 5 6*4)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Conversely, if both numerator and denominator are divided
by the same integer, the result is again an equivalent
fraction. For example:
)
36%8

(36%2)%(8%2)

(36%4)%(8%4)

36%4

8%4

9%2

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

This scheme will work only if numerator and denominator
share a common factor. Since 9 and 2 have no common
factor, the process of the preceding example can go no
further, and we say that 9%2 expresses the fraction 36%8 in
lowest possible form.

Thus, the lowest form is obtained by dividing
numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor,
or, as it is more commonly called, their greatest common
divisor (gcd).

J provides a gcd function denoted by +. used as follows:
)
36 +. 8          NB. Greatest common divisor

36 8 % (36 +. 8) NB. Lowest form

36%8             NB. Compare for equivalence

9%2

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

A table of the gcd verb shows interesting patterns.
Note, for example, the patterns of rows headed by
prime numbers:
)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 +.border 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 92-93. Polygons

A polygon can be described by the positions
of each of its vertices. We will begin by applying
the verb ,. to two lists to form a table, and then
plot the points defined by the rows of the table
to draw the polygon. For example:
)
1 4 3 ,. 6 2 1

PLOT 1 4 3 ,. 6 2 1

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The plot can be compared with the table to see that
the first row 1 6 is plotted at the point labelled
1 along the horizontal coordinate (often called the
x-coordinate) and at the point 6 along the vertical
(or y) coordinate; and that the line to the second point
(4 2) is followed by a line to the point 3 1 to complete
the triangle.

You can (and perhaps should) make similar plots by hand,
using squared paper marked off with numbers along
horizontal and vertical coordinates.

A triangle is, of course, a special case of a polygon,
and a quadrilateral may be made as follows:
)
1 4 3 5,.6 2 1 7

PLOT 1 4 3 5,.6 2 1 7

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The result of the foregoing plot is not a proper
quadrilateral, because the order of the points in
the table caused the lines to cross. This can be
rectified by changing the order of the points, using
the function take as illustrated below:
)

1 4 5 3,.6 2 7 1                NB. The polygon with crossing lines

(1 4 5 3,.6 2 7 1) take 1       NB. Take first row

(1 4 5 3,.6 2 7 1) take 3 1     NB. Take rows 3 and 1

(1 4 5 3,.6 2 7 1) take 1 4 2 3 NB. Re-order rows to remove crossing

PLOT (1 4 5 3,.6 2 7 1) take 1 4 2 3

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

Try to use PLOT to make one or more of the polygons
shown on page 92 of HS.

Lab Chapter LESSONS 21-40
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 100 Why Solve Equations?

The simple answer to the question "Why solve equations" is "Because
it is taught in math courses".

But for functions such as addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division there are more interesting
reasons for their importance -- the same may be true for matters
such as equations.

The brief answer is that the solution of equations provides a
general way of finding the result of an inverse function.

The study of inverse functions was introduced in Section 8 of
Chapter 2. For any function worth study, its inverse (that "undoes"
its work) is clearly important: addition of 4 is undone by its
inverse subtraction of 4, and multiplication by 4 is undone by
division by 4.

But how do you find the inverse of the square function?
To find, for example, a number that squared (multiplied by itself)
gives 5? The solution of an equation can provide the answer.

Our first discussion of inverse began with the successor function
(>:), important because it produces the counting numbers. Its
seemingly-innocent inverse (<:) led to the integers, that include
zero and the negative numbers.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

An equation remains true if each of its limbs (to the left and right of the equal
sign) are modified in the same way. Thus, Example 1 (with added parentheses)
is "Solve: (x +25) = 77". Subtraction of 25 leads to the equivalent equation
x = (77-25), or x = 52.

This last expression appears in the sentence "The solution is x = 52". But it is
shown in boldface, and implies something subtly different from an equation.
It might be stated as "x is assigned the value 52"

Lesson 75 introduces the notion of assignment as follows:

  In algebra we often use letters in place of numbers.
  The expression

       x + y

  means that two numbers are added. The value of the
  expression depends upon the numbers we choose for x
  and y Since the value of a letter may vary, a letter
  is called a variable.

In Example 1 of Lesson 75, the phrase "if a = 3" is used to
assign the value 3 to the letter a. In math, the phrase
"let a = 3" is also comonly used.

In J we use the phrase a =: 3, which uses the "copula"
=:, which is distinct from the = used in relations. The
phrase a =: 3 may be read simply as "a is 3". For example:
)
a=:3
a*a
x=:1 2 3 4
y=:2 3 5 7
x*y

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The term "variable" used in math is somewhat misleading, because
the value assigned to a letter does not vary under use. It may,
however, be changed by a later reassignment. This is the behavior of a
pronoun in English, and in J we prefer the term "pronoun" over "variable".
For example:
)
it=:3
it + it
it * it

it=:1 2 3
it + it
it * it

ages=:3 5 2 7 9 6
ages < 5

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The use of a multi-letter pronoun such as "ages" has the advantage
of being more mnemonic than a single letter.

Why then is algebra confined to the use of single letters?
The reason is the unfortunate (and usually unnoted) consequence
of permitting the omission of the multiplication sign in mathematics.
Thus, the product x*y may also be written as xy, making it
impossible to use multi-letter names: the name ages used in the
expression ages < 5 would have to be interpreted as the
product a*g*e*s.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section 104 Prime and Composite Numbers

Section 4. Remainder of Chapter 2 introduced the symbol | for the remainder
function, and showed remainder tables. We will continue this
as follows:
)
cn=:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 NB. Counting numbers

rt=: cn |/ cn NB. Remainder table
rt

The foregoing provides a definition of a prime number as a counting number
that has exactly two distinct divisors. It should be compared with the
boxed definition of Lesson 22, noting that it does not need the
extra condition that it must be "greater than 1".

In studying primes it is sometimes helpful to see a list of
them. This is conveniently provided by the function p: as shown below:

Lab Section 110 Simplifying Fractions and Mixed Numbers

Section 36-43 of Chapter 2 introduced the form 2r3 for the
rational number (or fraction) two-thirds, and the use of the extended precision
form to obtain results of division as rationals rather than as decimal
approximations. For example:
)
1 % 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

1 % 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10x

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The left argument of division is called the numerator, and the right
argument is called the denominator. If both are multiplied (or divided)
by the same number, the resulting quotient remains unchanged.
For example:
)
36 % 18

(36 * 2) % (18 * 2)

(36 % 2) % (18 % 2)

18 % 9

(18 % 9) % (9 % 9)

2 % 1

18 % 36  NB. Gives decimal approximation

18 % 36x NB. Gives rational result

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The process of dividing both numerator and denominator by a
factor that is common to both yields integers, and is said
to simplify the fraction. When no common factor remains
the fraction is said to be in lowest form. For example:
)
54 % 12  NB. Decimal approximation

54 % 12x NB. Extended precision gives rational result

27 % 6x  NB. Divide both by common factor 2

9 % 2x   NB. Divide both by common factor 3 to get lowest form

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

The reduction to lowest form could be completed in a single step
if we knew the value of the greatest common factor, or greatest common
divisor (gcd) as it is commonly called.

The gcd is given by the function +. as illustrated below:

54 +. 12

sum the columns to obtain a 1 in each position where the multiples
agree, and use this list of 1s to select from the multiples of 6
those that are common multiples of 4 and 6. The samllest of them is called the

Lab Section 155 Rounding whole numbers

Although this lesson concerns rounding numbers to the "nearest"
thousand, or hundred, or whatever, we will begin with the simpler
notion of using the "integer part" function (<.) to round "down", and from
it develop an expression for rounding to the nearest:
)
x=:3947

x%1000

1000*(<. x%1000)         NB. The largest whole thousand in x

1000 * <. 0.5 + x % 1000 NB. Rounds to nearest thousand

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section

We now define functions rounddown, and round (round nearest)
such that (x rounddown n) rounds x down to the next multiple of n, and
(x round n) rounds to the NEAREST multiple of n

that give the left and right arguments, and the function plushalf=:+&0.5 :

Lab Section 166. Decimal Fractions * Decimal Place Value

Lessons 28-31 treated earlier in this chapter introduced the
matter of reducing fractions by removing common prime factors,
by dividing numerator and denominator by their common divisors,
and eventually by their greatest common divisor given by the function +. .
They also introduced the function *. for the least common multiple,
and displayed the relation between the gcd and lcm tables. These lessons
should be reviewed before proceeding.

To experiment with modifications of numerator and denominator, we
will first define a function nd that gives us a list of them (in
reduced form) when applied to a fraction. Thus:
)
nd=:2&x:

nd 23r47

]x=:nd 18r56 NB. The right function (]) displays the named result

%/x*3        NB. Gives the same fraction

x%3          NB. Divide numerator and denominator by the same number

%/x%3        NB. Gives the same fraction

NB. =========================================================

When applied to a list of fractions, nd gives a table whose
rows represent the successive fractions. We must therefore
apply %/ to each row of the table as follows:

]y=:nd x

eachrow=:"1

Lab Section 236-240 Exponents

Using the term "power" as defined in the Glossary (page 654),

In J, the power function is denoted by ^, as illustrated below:

5 ^ 4

The pattern of the result of 5 ^ 1 2 3 4 5 shows that the each power can be obtained
from the next lower power by multiplying it by the "base" 5. Consequently, repeated
multiplication by the base extends the powers to the right.

Conversely, division by the base extends the pattern to the left, leading to a
consistent extension of the power to zero and negative exponents,
as illustrated below:

In Lesson 42 we used the table of coordinates to plot a hexagon, and the

The area of each triangle is approximately the length of its
base multiplied by the radius, all divided by 2. Moreover,
the sum of these bases can be used to get the sum of the areas, This
sum of bases is approximately the circumference, which is pi times the radius.

The total area is therefore approximately one-half of the radius times pi times the
radius. Moreover, the approximation improves as the number of divisions is
increased, and we conclude that the area of the circle is (pi*radius*radius) % 2:
)
radius=:2

o. radius          NB. pi times radius

o. *: radius       NB. pi times square of radius

(o. *: radius) % 2 NB. Area of circle

radius=:1

(o. *: radius) % 2 NB. Area of circle

Lab Section 477 Mean

In discussing averages we introduced a definition of the mean as the sum divided
by the number of elements. Thus:
)
mean=:+/ % #

a=: 8 5 6 3 1 7 7 10 4 6 9 1 1 6

+/a

# a

Lab Section 477 Median

To obtain the median we sort the argument and select the middle item
from the sorted list. For example, in the list a, the median is 6:

Lab Section 447 Mode

Among the list of distinct elements of the argument we seek the ones
that occur most often. To do this we first apply the nub function (~.)
to get the list of distinct elements, compare it with the original
argument in an equal table, and count the number of agreements. The element
(or elements) that occur most often constitute the mode:
)
a

~.a NB. The list of distinct elements

a =/ ~.a NB. Compared with each element of the argument

+/(a =/ ~.a) NB. Provides a count of agreements

NB. Elements in third and fifth places of the nub (that si, 6 and 1)
NB. constitute the mode

Lab Section 477 Range

The range is one more than the difference between the maximum and the
minimum, that is, between the last and first of the
sorted list:

({:-{.) sort a     NB. Difference of last and first

1 + ({:-{.) sort a NB. Range

Lab Section 592 Surface Area

If d is the list of dimensions of a rectangular solid, then */d
gives its volume. Moreover, the product of d with d rotated by 1 give
the three different face areas, and twice their sum gives the
total surface area. For example:
)
d=:5 3 7

*/d                 NB. Volume

1 |. d              NB. Rotate by 1

d * 1 |. d          NB. Each different surface area

2 * +/ (d * 1 |. d) NB. Total surface area
