Lab Section Introduction
We will use the computer not to further burden the accepted
curriculum, but to provide the teacher with a simple general
aide to help in the teaching of it.

This help includes such things as evaluating results of
exercises; showing graphs and collections of graphs;
and coloring multiplication and other function tables to emphasize
the patterns that occur in them.

Lab Chapter FUNCTION TABLES
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Bare and Bordered Tables
In the following examples we will use NB. (Nota Bene) to
append comments -- which are not treated as part of the
preceding expression. For example:
)
+ table 1 2 3 4 5 NB. An addition table (with arguments)

+ bare 1 2 3 4 5  NB. A bare addition table

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
 The arguments included in the
 addition table make it easy
 to interpret, but the bare
 table makes it easier to
 concentrate on the relations
 between the sums.

 We now show the use of color
 to emphasize these relations.

 Press the key
 Esc to remove
 the color window
 so that you may
 proceed to the
 next panel.
)
+ bare 1 2 3 4 5

color + bare 1 2 3 4 5 NB. Color equal values alike

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Experiments
To experiment with this facility, type the
following expressions, pressing the Enter
key to execute each of them:

   - table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   color - bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4

   * table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4

   color * bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 - 4
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
In the preceding panel you could have avoided
typing (and mistyping) the entries by using the
up-arrow key to move the cursor up to an expression,
pressing enter to bring it down to the "input area"
(where it may be modified by typing and by using the left and right
arrows and the delete key), and again pressing Enter to
execute it. Try this on the following:

   i:4 NB. A list of integers from _4 to 4

   color * bare i:4

   < table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7      NB. A comparison table

   color < bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 NB. Esc removes color window

   = table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

   color = bare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Selecting chapters
You may also use the Up Arrow or Page Up to review earlier panels, and
Down Arrow or Page Down to move back down.

To begin at the beginning of any chapter, click on Studio, then on Chapters
(in the dropped menu), then on the desired chapter.

NB. =========================================================
Lab Chapter GRAMMAR
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Mathematics as a Language
Although the notation of mathematics is commonly
recognized as a language, it is not common to examine
its grammar. Nevertheless, it can be helpful to explore some
analogies with English -- in the expression sin(1.57),
the function sin performs an action upon the number
1.57, analogous to the action of a verb upon a noun.

Moreover, in the expression + table 1 2 3 4 5, table
modifies the verb + to produce a related verb. It is
therefore analogous to an adverb.

This simple notion of modifying a verb
to produce a related verb (fruitful in both
math and English) is often made
difficult by introducing it very late, commonly
in the treatment of differential equations, where it is
called an operator (or Heaviside operator).

Finally, the assignment of a name to a noun (as in Let
x=3), is analogous to the introduction of a pronoun.
To call this name a "variable" can be misleading,
especially in a case such as Let pi=3.1416, where
its value is clearly not intended to vary.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Assignment and Equality
In math, the distinction between the COMPARISON
pi=3.1416, and the ASSIGNMENT of the value
3.1416 to the name pi, is made by writing
Let pi=3.1416 for the latter. Programming languages simply
use a similar symbol, and no Let -- (we will use =:
and refer to it by the proper English term "copula"). For example:
)
x=:3 NB. The copula =: assigns a value to the pronoun x
x < 4
x<1 2 3 4 5 6
x=1 2 3 4 5 6 NB. Equality comparison
x=:5          NB. Assigns a new value to the pronoun
x=1 2 3 4 5 6 NB. Comparison using the new value

x=: i: 3
color * bare x

NB. =========================================================
Lab Chapter LITERAL ARGUMENTS
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Relations
It is commonly assumed that mathematics is about
numbers. So it is, but it would be more accurate
to say that math is about relations, and that relations
are observable as patterns -- matters
emphasized in the foregoing uses of
numbers and tables of numbers. To emphasize this
point further we will introduce non-numeric
arguments called literals.

We may say that MAY is the sister of AMY, but we
say that 'MAY' is an anagram of 'AMY', using quotes
to indicate that we are speaking about two three-letter
words, not about two girls. In the following examples
we will apply the anagram function A. to various words:
)
1 A. 'AMY' NB. An anagram, but not an English word or name
0 1 2 3 4 5 A. 'AMY' NB. All six anagrams of 'AMY'
color 0 1 2 3 4 5 A. 'AMY'

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Number of Anagrams
The foregoing color window illustrated why
there are exactly 3*2*1 distinct anagrams
(permutations) of a list of three elements.
We may therefore expect to see 4*3*2*1 (factorial
4) anagrams of a four-letter word.

(Click the middle button of the color window
to alternately maximize and minimize its size.)
)
!4   NB. Factorial 4 (4*3*2*1)

i.!4 NB. 24 integers beginning at 0

color (i.!4)A. 'OPST'

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Permutations
Having made the point of using non-numeric arguments
to explore relations, we may now remark that the
anagram function applies to lists of numbers as
well as to lists of literals.

Anagrams of numeric lists are commonly called permutations:
)
(i.!4)A.1 2 3 4

color (i.!4)A.1 2 3 4

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Orientations of Tables
The table (i.!4)A.1 2 3 4 may be more readable if
"flipped on its diagonal" to show the rows as columns.
We provide three functions which together
provide all possible orientations of a table:
)
t1=:- bare 1 2 3
t1
fod t1 NB. Flip on diagonal (- is non-commutative)
foh t1 NB. Flip on horizontal axis
fov t1 NB. Flip on vertical axis

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Selection and Subscripts
Subscripts are commonly used to index lists
and tables. We will use the function sub as
illustrated below -- it uses indices beginning at 0 rather
than at 1:
)
x=:2 3 5 7 11
x sub 0
x sub 2 4

t1 sub 1             NB. Select row
(fod t1) sub 1       NB. Select column

fod (fod t1) sub 2 0 NB. Select columns

NB. =========================================================
Lab Chapter PLOTS
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Bare and Lined Plots
Graphs (or plots) are an effective way to display
the results of a function. To use a grid x1 for plotting
sin x1, we will write plot x1 for sin x1, as illustrated below:
)
x1=:0.5*i:7
x1
plot x1 for sin x1

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Finer grids may also be used. Moreover, the alternative function PLOT
adds vertical lines from each point:
)
x2=:0.1*i:30

PLOT x2 for sin x2

NB. The names x1 and x2 will be used repeatedly,
NB. and you should not assign new values to them.

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Multiple Plots
Several curves can be plotted together in various
ways. For example, fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 gives a table
which, when its sines are plotted, shows sines
displaced in phase:
)
fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 NB. "flip on diagonal" (also called "transpose")

plot x1 for sin fod x1 + bare 0 1 2 3

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Curves may also be plotted together in the
manner illustrated below:
)
>(sin x1);(cos x1);(cos x1+0.2)

plot x1 for >(sin x1);(cos x1);(cos x1+0.2)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Plots Against Other Than the Grid
The expression plot x2 for sin x2 may be said to
plot sin x2 "against" x2. Since sin x2 is normally plotted
against x2, it appears unnecessary to include "x2 for"
in the expression. However, sin x2 can also be plotted
against other functions to produce unusual results:
)
plot (cos x2) for (sin x2)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The result is a circle (as indicated by the
scales on the plot) even though it might appear
to be an ellipse. This appearance can be modified
by clicking on the lower edge of the plot and holding
the mouse button to drag it up or down.

Incidentally, the entire graph can be moved out
of the way of text by similarly clicking on the top
bar.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Try any other interesting cases known from mathematics.
For example:
)
plot (sin x2) for (sin 2*x2)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Surface Plots
Corresponding points of a collection of curves
can be joined together to form a surface. For example:
)
'surface' plot sin x1 + bare 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Chapter PUZZLES
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Puzzle 1
Certain puzzling things that occur in mathematics
are due, at least in part, to the notation
used. We will discuss a few examples.

1. In high school algebra, why do we not use
mnemonic names and abbreviations such as age and
wgt, rather than limiting ourselves to single
letters such as x and y?

The answer is that we ruled out multi-letter
names by adopting the "convenient" abbreviation xy for the
product of x and y -- denoted by x*y in most
programming languages. In other words, age
would be interpreted as a*g*e, and pi as p*i.

Since the work is limited to single-letter names, students may miss the important fact that
algebra introduces into mathematics the use
of NAMES, rather than the use of LETTERS.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Moreover, if x and y have the values 3 and 4,
then it should be possible to write 34 or 3y
or x3 for the product of x and y given by the
case xy. Only the case 3y would be understood
as the intended product.

The important principle of the substitutability
of equivalent values in mathematical expressions
is therefore contravened by the convention concerning xy.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Puzzle 2
2. Because a*(b+c) is equivalent to (a*b)+(a*c),
we say that multiplication "distributes" over
addition.

Because * is "commutative" [that is, its result remains unchanged
if its arguments are interchanged, or "commuted"], (b+c)*a is also equivalent to (a*b)+(a*c).
We will test these assertions by assigning values to
the three names:
)
a=:2
b=:3
c=:5

a*(b+c)
(a*b)+(a*c)

(b+c)*a
(b*a)+(c*a)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Using % to denote "divided by", we will explore
the question of whether division distributes over addition:
)
a%(b+c)
(a%b)+(a%c)

(b+c)%a
(b%a)+(c%a)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The first identity fails, but the second
does not. This is sometimes addressed by
saying that "division distributes to the left,
but not to the right".

More precisely, we may say that "divide and a right
argument a" is a function of one argument (written
as %&a, and read aloud as "divide and a" or "divide with a") that distributes over addition, but that
the function a&% does not. For example:
)
%&a (b+c)

(%&a b)+(%&a c)

g=: a&% NB. Assign a name to the other case

g (b+c)

(g b)+(g c)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
From this it appears clearer to speak of the distributivity
of a monadic function (one applied to a single
argument) such as %&a, than of the distributivity
of the dyadic function from which it may be derived.

In particular, we may say that a linear function
is one that distributes over addition -- a statement
that presents a strong reason for the importance of
linear functions.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Puzzle 3
3. If a list of five numbers is partitioned by
taking the first three and dropping the first three,
then the sums of the parts may be added to give the
same result as the sum over the original list. For example:
)
x=:1 2 3 4 5
3 take x
sum 3 take x

3 drop x
sum 3 drop x

(sum 3 take x)+(sum 3 drop x)
sum x
(sum 0 take x)+(sum 0 drop x)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The final example used 0 to partition x into an
empty list and the entire list, raising the question
of what meaning should be ascribed to the sum
over an empty list.

Not surprisingly, the result must be 0, because
0 is the "identity element" of addition, that is, a number
which added to any x gives x An identity element
of a function is also called its "neutral".

We will now explore the corresponding case of multiplication:
)
(prod 3 take x)*(prod 3 drop x)
prod x
(prod 0 take x)*(prod 0 drop x)

prod 0 take x

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
In this case, the product over the empty list
is not 0, but 1 -- the neutral of multiplication.

This very useful inclusion and treatment of empty lists is not
commonly made in mathematical notation.

Experiment with
the dyadic function min and its monadic counterpart
minof to find the neutral of the minimum function.
In particular, test whether it indeed behaves as a neutral.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The experiments concerning the identity element
of minimum suggest that it might be used
as the DEFINITION of infinity (denoted here by _).
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Puzzle 4
4. Need for the treatment of empty lists
arises in many ways. For example, a binomial
coefficient (commonly denoted by an n above a k with enclosing
parentheses, and denoted here by k!n) is commonly
defined by a fraction with a denominator of k factors -- that
is: k(k-1)...(1).

But what is to be made of the case k=:0, that is,
a product over an empty list? The needed result is
of course 1, as developed in the foregoing panels.
)
n=:4
k=:2
k!n

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ! 4

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Tables of the binomial coefficient function appear as:
)
! table 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

! bare 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Puzzle 5
5. Although x/y and 3/4 are commonly used to denote
division, there may be little agreement
about the meanings of x/y/z and xy/z and x/yz,
because they depend on the order of execution in the
phrases.

Since 3/4 is also used to denote the fraction (or
rational) three-quarters (as in the phrase "a 3/4 inch
drill") the phrases 3/4/z and x/3/4 raise further questions,
because a fraction 3/4 must be so interpreted before
any division takes place.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The treatment of rationals may be clarified
by using 3r4 to denote the rational three-quarters.
For example:
)
z=:1 1r2 1r3 1r4 1r5 1r6
+ table z
* table z

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
)
% table z
max table z
color max bare z

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
3 rem 5 gives the remainder on dividing 5 by 3.
Produce and color a remainder table for the
integer argument 0 1 2 3 4 5.

Repeat for the rational argument z. Also observe the color window
produced by the following:
)
color 3 rem 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Lab Chapter DERIVATIVES AND INTEGRALS
NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Derivative Adverbs
The adverbs d.1 and d.2 and so on produces derivatives.
For example:
)
plot x2 for sin d.1 x2

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Integral Adverbs
Similarly d._1 and d._2 and so on produce integrals:
)
PLOT x2 for sin d._1 x2 NB. Integral of sin is -cos

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Identity Adverb
The adverb d.0 is the identity. Moreover, collections
of adverbs may be applied, but the result must be
flipped on the diagonal. For example:
)
plot x2 for fod sin d. _1 0 1 x2

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Experiments
Try other cases and comment on the results. For example:

plot x2 for fod sin d. 0 4 x2

plot x2 for fod (sin * cos) d. 0 1 x2

plot x2 for fod (sin + cos) d. 0 1 x2

plot x2 for fod (sin - cos) d. 0 1 x2

plot x2 for fod (sin % cos) d. 1 x2

plot x2 for fod exp d. 0 1 x2  NB. Exponential = its deriv.

plot x2 for fod (sin % exp) x2 NB. Decaying sin

plot x2 for fod (sin % exp on -:) x2 NB. Decay at 1/2 rate
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Coefficients of Derivatives of Polynomials
The derivative of the polynomial c&p. is another
polynomial d&p., where d is obtained from c by
multiplying by its (zero-origin) indices, and then dropping the
first element. For example:
)
c=:4 1 3 2
# c    NB. number of items of c
i.#c   NB. Zero origin indices of c
c*i.#c NB. Product with indices

d=:1 drop c*i.#c
d
x=:i:3
x
plot x for > (c&p. x);(d&p. x)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The function p.. has just been adopted, and does not work
in early versions of this system. Applied monadically to a list
of coefficients, it gives the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

Moreover, the dyadic use ct p.. c gives the
coefficients of the integral with constant term
ct. For example:
)
c
p.. c   NB. Fails in early versions of J
3 p.. c
