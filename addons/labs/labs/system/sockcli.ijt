If you did not start this lab in response to instructions in the Socket Driver Server lab currently running in another J task you should stop running this lab. In order to see the socket lab illustrating client-server communication, start the "Socket Driver Server" lab, and follow the instructions there.

Position the 2 copies of J (server and client) as conveniently as possible on your screen. If you have a large screen you can probably position them so that you can see both sessions at the same time.

We connect to the server at its address.

The address has 3 parts: The first part indicates the type of address and must be AF_INET, i.e. address family internet.

The second part is the internet address of the host on which the server is running.

The last part is the port number.

Lab Section
You need to get the internet address of the system.

sdgethostbyname converts a "user friendly" host name into the string of 4 numbers that is the internet address. The hostname "localhost" is a name for your system.

The result of sdgethostname includes the AF_INET value of 2.

sdconnect connects to a server.

The port number of 1500 is the service that we want.

The sdconnect parameters give the address of the socket to connect to. They are similar to the bind parameters the server used.

You should have just finished working in the server task and sending some data to this task.

sdselect should show that our socket is now ready to read data. This is indicated by our socket in the readable socket list.

The socket is also marked as ready to write.

sdrecv receives data from the socket. The argument after the socket is the maximum amount of data that will be received. The 0 argument after that is flags.

The amount of data received may be less than the amount in the argument.

Let us send some data to the server.

Notice that we do sends in a row. The server just sees this as a string of incoming data, similar to reading data from a file. The boundaries of chunks of sent data have no relationship to the boundaries of chunks of received data.
