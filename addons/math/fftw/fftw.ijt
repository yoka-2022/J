Lab Section FFTW
Fast Fourier Transform routines in J are based on the FFTW library, i.e. the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West.

FFTW is a comprehensive collection of fast C routines for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of arbitrary input size.

FFTW was developed at MIT by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson, and a full description is available at the FFTW home page: http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~fftw/

FFTW is licensed under the GNU General Public License, see addons/math/fftw/gpl.htm.

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Source Files
The FFTW routines are packaged in file libfftw3-3.dll, which includes the complete set of complex number routines in FFTW.

These routines are accessible to J through the J DLL call mechanism as documented in User Manual chapter "Dlls and Memory Management".

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The scripts and other files for FFTW are in subdirectory math/fftw of the addons directory, i.e.
)
jpath '~addons/math/fftw'

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Loading FFTW
Load the fftw.ijs script to access FFTW.

The main definitions for FFTW are read into locale jfftw.

Two verbs are defined in the z locale:

   fftw     forward FFT
   ifftw    backward FFT
)
load 'math/fftw'

Lab Section Examples
Here is a simple example:
)
fftw i.8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
This example is easily verified by direct computation in J.

The discrete FFT for vector f is given by:

            N-1
  F(k) = sigma f(n) exp ((- j 2 pi n k)/N)     k = 0 ... N-1
            n=0

The verb dfft defined below implements the above expression, and matches the result of fftw. However, it is very inefficient for large arguments.

Note that we remove small rounding errors by using the verb clean from the numeric script.
)
dfft=: 3 : '+/ y * ^ (#y) %~ (- o. 0j2 ) * */~ i.#y'

require 'numeric'
clean (dfft - fftw) i.8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
The inverse FFT is given by:

   ifftw

or equivalently:

   fftw inverse

Note that the inverse is normalized, so that the inverse FFT returns the original data.
)
ifftw fftw i.8

fftw inverse fftw i.8

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
Doing a FFT followed by an inverse FFT returns the original data, so that the following expression is everywhere zero:

   dat - ifftw fftw dat

In practice, there may be small rounding errors.  Again, we use clean to remove these.
)

A=: ?.~ 8

A - ifftw fftw A

clean A - ifftw fftw A

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
In general, the arguments to fftw and ifftw are complex, multidimensional arrays.

The next section computes the FFT on a random complex, 6-dimensional array of shape 3 4 5 6 7 8. This may take a few seconds to run.

A=: j./ ?. 1 + i. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

$A

$B=: fftw A

$C=: ifftw B

+/ , clean A - C      NB. A matches C

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Other Facilities
The verbs fftw and ifftw should cover practically all uses of FFTW.

However, there are two other facilities that are designed to optimize repeated uses of the FFTW library on arguments of the same shape, which are supported by the utilities in the jfftw locale:

   saved plans
   performance measures
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section
When using the underlying facilities directly, take care to ensure the arguments given are correct. Calling DLL procedures incorrectly can crash your system or corrupt memory.
)

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Saved Plans
The verbs fftw and ifftw dynamically create and destroy plans. If you are calling an FFT on same sized arrays repeatedly, you can create and reuse a plan, destroying it when no longer required.

In the following example, a plan is created for a 2 3 4 array, and FFT is called twice using it:
)
shape=: 2 3 4
data=: j./? 1+ i.2, shape                   NB. random data

NB. get data in right shape for library call and allocate
NB. space for output.
in=: (,|:data)
out=: in * 0

[P=: createplan_jfftw_ shape;(symdat<'in');(symdat<'out');_1;64   NB. create plan

NB. execute plan.  Result goes to out, which we must reshape
fftwexecute_jfftw_ P
|: (|.shape) $ out

data=: j./? 1+ i.2, shape                   NB. new random data

in=: (,|:data) a: } in                      NB. in-place update of input data

fftwexecute_jfftw_ P                        NB. reuse existing plan
|: (|.shape) $ out

destroyplan_jfftw_ P                        NB. destroy plan

NB. =========================================================
Lab Section Performance Measures
The final argument to the verb createplan is a flag, 0=MEASURE or 64=ESTIMATE, where ESTIMATE is the default.

Plans created with the MEASURE flag are optimized for a given array size. It takes much longer to create such plans than with ESTIMATE, and so you would do this only when a large number of FFTs are to be calculated for the same array shape.

When creating plans with the ESTIMATE flag you may set up the input either before or after creating the plan.  But when creating plans with the MEASURE flag, you must set up the input after creating the plan.

The next section creates a plan with a performance measure. It will take a little longer to run, most of the time being spent creating the plan.
