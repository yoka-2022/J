NB. DGEEV computes the eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors for GE
NB. matrices
NB. 
NB. Purpose:
NB. 
NB.      DGEEV computes for an N-by-N real nonsymmetric matrix A, the
NB.      eigenvalues and, optionally, the left and/or right eigenvectors.
NB. 
NB.      The right eigenvector v(j) of A satisfies
NB.                       A * v(j) = lambda(j) * v(j)
NB.      where lambda(j) is its eigenvalue.
NB.      The left eigenvector u(j) of A satisfies
NB.                    u(j)**H * A = lambda(j) * u(j)**H
NB.      where u(j)**H denotes the conjugate-transpose of u(j).
NB. 
NB.      The computed eigenvectors are normalized to have Euclidean norm
NB.      equal to 1 and largest component real.
