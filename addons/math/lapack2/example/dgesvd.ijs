NB. DGESVD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) for GE matrices
NB. 
NB. Purpose:
NB. 
NB.      DGESVD computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
NB.      M-by-N matrix A, optionally computing the left and/or right singular
NB.      vectors. The SVD is written
NB. 
NB.           A = U * SIGMA * transpose(V)
NB. 
NB.      where SIGMA is an M-by-N matrix which is zero except for its
NB.      min(m,n) diagonal elements, U is an M-by-M orthogonal matrix, and
NB.      V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix.  The diagonal elements of SIGMA
NB.      are the singular values of A; they are real and non-negative, and
NB.      are returned in descending order.  The first min(m,n) columns of
NB.      U and V are the left and right singular vectors of A.
NB. 
NB.      Note that the routine returns V**T, not V.
