NB. DGETRF
NB. 
NB. DGETRF VARIANT: iterative version of Sivan Toledo's recursive LU algorithm
NB. 
NB. DGETRF VARIANT: left-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.
NB. 
NB. Purpose:
NB. 
NB.      DGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
NB.      using partial pivoting with row interchanges.
NB. 
NB.      The factorization has the form
NB.         A = P * L * U
NB.      where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
NB.      diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper
NB.      triangular (upper trapezoidal if m < n).
NB. 
NB.      This is the right-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.

NB.                                   has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
NB.                                   singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
NB.                                   to solve a system of equations.

NB. DGETRI
NB. 
NB. Purpose:
NB. 
NB.      DGETRI computes the inverse of a matrix using the LU factorization
NB.      computed by DGETRF.

NB.                              matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
NB. 
NB.                              WORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
NB.     [out]    WORK            On exit, if INFO=0, then WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
NB. 
NB.                              LWORK is INTEGER
NB.                              The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK >= max(1,N).

NB.                              If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
NB.                              only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
NB.                              this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
