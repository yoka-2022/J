NB. DPPTRF
NB. 
NB. Purpose:
NB. 
NB.      DPPTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
NB.      positive definite matrix A stored in packed format.
NB. 
NB.      The factorization has the form
NB.         A = U**T * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
NB.         A = L  * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
NB.      where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.
